# Draw What You Hear: High-fidelity Image Generation and Manipulation via SoundAdapter


## Requirements
- We recommend you to use Anaconda to create a conda environment:
```Shell
conda env create -f env.yml
```

Download the pretrained [checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/YSYS1103/SoundAdapter/blob/main/SD_checkpoint.pth.tar) and save it in the checkpoints folder like:
